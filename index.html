            <p class="post-content">college life

students come here from various places , where they enter into a  new word with full of expecations and fears
They meet new people , they start trusting them , they share their problems, food, clothes
and this friendships take them into a great heights.

Friends and friendships are the things which helps to over come problems
we learn so many things like bunking classes, going to movies , proxy attendances, fights and making gangs and etc

some people will become best friends to starnger and some become strangers to best friends
years passes like days and month , without knowing 4 years of beautiful college life comes to and end 

u will not have time to chill or spend some quality time with your people where one will be busy with interviews, projects, clearing supplies and doing internship

Enjoy ur engineering life
