students come here from various places , where they enter into a  new word with full of expecations and fears
They meet new people , they start trusting them , they share their problems, food, clothes
and this friendships take them into a great heights.
Friends and friendships are the things which helps to over come problems
we learn so many things like bunking classes, going to movies , proxy attendances, fights and making gangs and etc
some people will become best friends to starnger and some become strangers to best friends

            I've been waiting for you for so long, and now that you are here with me, I will never ever let you go. We both know that life is not always fair. We know that there will come a time when we have to face trials in our relationship, but we will overcome because our love will see us through. They say promises are made to broken, but I say promises is meant to be for as long as we believe in the power of love... I know in my heart you believe it too. I am so thankful. and so very happy that I have found my destiny in you.
You are my happiness, a very special blessing God has given to me. I'm so excited spending my whole life with someone that I truly love and care about, spending each special day with all the love in our heart of hearts. I love you so much and will always love until forever. That's a promise that I'll surely going to keep forever in my heart.

                     <h2>GUITARIST</h2>
                 </p>
<p class="post-content">Life OF A Guitarist

being a guitarist is not a easy thing which takes alots of effects, hardwork and focus
the passion for doing anything is more important and while your playing an musical instrument u need to have something called pichhiii/ madness
Most of the people be like what is there is playing guitar so easy and they do more over actions and its only for impressing people ani
but only the person who play an instrument will know the hard work and the time he spended for playing or for learning the music 
at a time ur mind and body needs to work because while your playing anything its need to be perfect and we need to play according to the music or the tune
we need to be active and ready while playing anything and we need to be advance to guess or play music.
people think its for show and poses only but see the hands of the guitarist while he is playing or after the performance , his fingers will have black marks and skin will be cutted due to the string , they have so much of pain but they do it with love and for enterinating people
so never judge anything whithout knowing that it is or with having knowledge.
